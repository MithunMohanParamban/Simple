				 <p> The Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical). 
					 Such self-monitoring and self-sensing, which combines wearable sensors (EEG, ECG, video, etc.) and wearable computing, is also known as life logging. 
					 Other names for using self-tracking data to improve daily functioning are “self-tracking”, "auto-analytics", “body hacking”, “self-quantifying”, self-surveillance, life logging, surveillance, and Humanistic Intelligence. 
					 In short, quantified self is self-knowledge through self-tracking with technology.

				 <p> It has always confused me, as to what controls my mind and behavior. I am now realizing the fact that it is Music. 
					 The Genre of the song defines my mood and my heart beats to the tune of the music I hear. 
					 The songs I hear give soul to my lifeless body. 
				     It makes me who I am. Let me tell you about myself, I am Nishanth Fenn a.k.a ThePsilentPsycho. I like everything from
					 books, music,tv-series to all the things that i can get my hands on, especially porn.
